# MVI architecture study

This repo shows my take on the MVI architecture. Implementation is based on Jake Wharton's Managing State with RxJava talk
as well as this [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls0uKLqNFz4&list=PLsAfcuwrBov7NJOcGxBN7FU0SQdid6L0j). Any feedback
is welcome as I am trying to improve my understanding of this architecture.

The app shows a paginated list of github repos and loads the next page when the user reaches the bottom of the list.
